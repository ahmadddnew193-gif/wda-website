### **What Problem Are We Solving?**

In today's digital-first world, businesses face three major challenges:

**1. Poor Online Presence**
- 75% of consumers judge a company's credibility based on their website design
- Many businesses have outdated, slow, or non-existent websites
- This leads to lost customers and missed opportunities

**2. Inconsistent Branding**
- Companies struggle to maintain a cohesive brand identity across platforms
- Without professional design, businesses blend into the background
- They fail to make lasting impressions on potential customers

**3. Technical Complexity**
- Building modern websites requires specialized skills

**The result?** Businesses lose customers to competitors with better digital experiences, miss out on revenue, and struggle to grow in the online marketplace.

**That's where WDA comes in.** We solve these problems by providing professional, affordable, and comprehensive digital solutions.
